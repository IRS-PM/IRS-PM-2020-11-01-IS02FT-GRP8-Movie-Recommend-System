## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
With the rapid development of the film industry, all kinds of films on the platform have expanded and increased exponentially. In such a huge movie database, it is very difficult for moviegoers to decide which movie to watch. Recommendation systems are widely used in the Internet industry, with personalized recommendations for takeaway apps, shopping apps, etc. In order to save the time for moviegoers to investigate and analyze the huge number of movies, we built this movie recommendation system. This system will recommend a list of movies suitable for watching based on the preferences of the moviegoers.


Our group consists of four students who love movies and  we usually watch movies in our leisure time. However, the current personalized recommendation function of video apps is not very complete. Most of the recommendations are based on the general data of the movie market, and there is no personalized recommendation. So we want to complete a personalized movie recommendation system, which can recommend a movie list according to each userâ€™s own preferences

In order to implement this system, we first built a database containing the detailed content of each movie. The data comes from open source movie data on the Internet. Then we use Python to build the front-end UI and back-end data processing system, and connect them. Finally, it can be visited for experience through an independent URL.

We believe that this system has great commercial value. Movies are the most popular leisure activity for people nowadays. Nowadays, there are many movies on the market, and people don't know how to choose a movie that suits them. Through such a recommendation system, it saves the time for viewers to investigate and also allows them to see movies that suit their tastes.
